# KiCAD setup and learning

First, I downloaded KiCAD and messed around with it a bit until I understood the function of most of the buttons. I found tutorials such as Joe Scotto on YouTube and watched lots of tutorials until I became completely comfortable using the KiCad Software.

# Made the PCB's schematic

It took me a while to get the hang of making a functional PCB with KiCAD and not just inserting random things onto the screen. The concept of the rows and columns also confused me quite a bit at first, but after spending a while mapping out the current flow and how the code would work, it made sense. I know 4 hours sounds like an insane amount of time to make a schematic, but I had no knowledge of PCB designing before this.

# Exported the schematic and started making the PCB

I ran into numerous issues exporting the PCB as the system wouldn't let me directly convert my schematic to it. Due to this, I had to export the nelist into the PCB editor. However, when I exported the netlist, I got errors that some of my parts weren't imported due to a footprint error. I removed the libraries and added them an insane amount of times until all the components finally imported. Overall, I just imported all the components and made the grid layout for my keys.

# Finished making the PCB

I rerouted the tracks a couple of times to make sure the organization is clean. Other than that, I didn't run into many issues here.

# Started making the CAD for the Macropad Case

I made the top plate, but there are still interference issues with other components that need to be fixed.

# Started making the CAD for the Macropad Case

I fixed the interference issues, cleaned up the top plate, and branded it.
